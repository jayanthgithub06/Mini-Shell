# Mini-Shell
A mini shell (msh) implemented in C to mimic basic BASH functionality. Supports custom prompts, command execution, signal handling (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z), special variables, job control (bg, fg, jobs), and built-in commands like cd, pwd, and exit. Learn Linux internals via system calls and process management.
